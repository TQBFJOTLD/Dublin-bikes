   Dublin Bike App is an app to help users make an informed decision on which JCDecaux bike station to use in Dublin. The App will present the user the average number of bikes available on nearby stations based on wheather, the day of the week and time. 
   
   The Group project will have an AWS ECS web scraping component to accumulate historical data for both weather and bike stations. It will also include an AWS RDS database component to store the accumulated data and perform data queries. Lastly, it will also include a client side component that serves as the user interface.
